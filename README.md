# The Unbelievers Podcast

## The time has come

Now that I am more familiar with React, I want to try building out a better version of the show website.
When I initially created the website, we weren't sure how long we would be doing the show.  Now that we have over 100 episodes with no signs of slowing down the show needs a website that fits its scale.

* Pagination
* Faster load time
* Better way to add episodes
* Database structure instead of hard coding

## Anticipated Steps

* Basic scaffolding
* Basic mobile/desktop navigation and layout
* Work with team on new design/features
* Scrape existing site for episode data
* Set up backend -- serving different pages, episode database, etc
* Pagination for episodes -- possibly allowing visiters to select number of results per page etc.
* Search feature of episode topic tags from Spreaker
