# The Unbelievers Podcast

## The time has come

Now that I am more familiar with React, I want to try building out a better version of the show website.
When I initially created the website, we weren't sure how long we would be doing the show.  Now that we have over 100 episodes with no signs of slowing down the show needs a website that fits its scale.

* Pagination
* Faster load time
* Better way to add episodes
* Database structure instead of hard coding
